# sql_fundamental_1
A friendly introduction to SQL for self-learners like myself. This exercise is useful for those without access to MySQL or PostgreSQL. I ran the exercise in JupyterLab via Anaconda Navigator, using SQLite, a lightweight, standalone, and reliable SQL database engine built as a C-based library.
